abstract: 'From the Publisher: This second editon describes C as defined by the ANSI
  standard. This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. The book
  assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment
  statements, loops, and functions. A novice programmer should be able to read along
  and pick up the language. FEATURES: All examples have been tested, which is in machine-readable
  form. It discusses various aspects of C in more detail, although the emphasis is
  on examples of complete programs, rather than isolated fragments. It deals with
  basic data types, operators and expressions. Covers functions and program structure,
  external variables, scope rules, multiple source files, and also touches on the
  preprocessor. It also describes an interface between C programs and the UNIX operating
  system, concentrating on input/output, the file system, and storage allocation.
  It also provides a language reference manual. The official statement of the syntax
  and semantics of C is the ANSI standard.'
